Messi vs Ronaldo

In Chefland, a football player gets 2 points for each goal and 1 point for each assist.

Messi has A goals and B assists this season, whereas Ronaldo has X goals and Y assists.
Find out the player with more points this season.

Input Format
The first and only line of input will contain four space-separated integers A B X Y, the number of goals and assists that Messi and Ronaldo have, respectively.

Output Format
Print a single line containing:
Messi, if Messi has more points than Ronaldo.
Ronaldo, if Ronaldo has more points than Messi.
Equal, if both have equal points.
You can print in any letter-case (e.g., Messi, MESSI, messi).

Constraints
0 ≤ A, B, X, Y ≤ 100

Program
a,b,x,y=map(int,input().split())
if (a*2+b*1)>(x*2+y*1):
    print("Messi")
elif (a*2+b*1)<(x*2+y*1):
    print("Ronaldo")
else:
    print("Equal")

Sample 1

Input:
40 30 50 10

Output:
Equal

Explanation:
Messi → 40×2 + 30 = 110
Ronaldo → 50×2 + 10 = 110
Both have 110 points.

Sample 2

Input:
91 22 60 30

Output:
Messi

Explanation:
Messi → 91×2 + 22 = 204
Ronaldo → 60×2 + 30 = 150
Messi has more points.

Sample 3

Input:
60 30 80 20

Output:
Ronaldo

Explanation:
Messi → 60×2 + 30 = 150
Ronaldo → 80×2 + 20 = 180
Ronaldo has more points.





Program 2

Single-use Attack

Chef is playing a video game, and is now fighting the final boss.
The boss has H health points. Each attack of Chef reduces the health of the boss by X. Chef also has a special attack that can be used at most once, and will decrease the health of the boss by Y.
Chef wins when the health of the boss is ≤ 0. What is the minimum number of attacks needed by Chef to win?

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line containing three space-separated integers H X Y — the parameters described in the statement.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of attacks needed by Chef to win.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ X < Y ≤ H ≤ 100

Program
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    h,x,y=map(int,input().split())
    print(min((h+x-1)//x,1+max(0,h-y+x-1)//x))

Input:
4
100 25 40
100 29 45
46 1 2
78 15 78

Output:
4
3
45
1

Explanation:
Test case 1: Chef can attack normally 4 times: 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 = 100 damage.
Test case 2: Two normal attacks and the special: 29 + 29 + 45 = 103 damage.
Test case 3: Use the special first (46 − 2 = 44), then 44 normal attacks of 1 damage each: total 1 + 44 = 45.
Test case 4: Use the special attack to immediately bring health to zero, needing only 1 attack.
