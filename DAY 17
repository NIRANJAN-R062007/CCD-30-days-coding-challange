Program 1

Final Population

There were initially X million people in a town, out of which Y million people left the town and Z million people immigrated to the town.
Determine the final population of the town in millions.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
Each test case contains three integers X, Y, Z.

Output Format
For each test case, output the final population of the town in millions.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ X, Y, Z ≤ 10
Y ≤ X

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x,y,z=map(int,input().split())
    print(x-y+z)

Input
4
3 1 2
2 2 2
4 1 8
10 1 10

Output
4
2
11
19

Explanation

Test case 1:
Initial population = 3 million
Left = 1 million
Immigrated = 2 million
Final population = 3 − 1 + 2 = 4 million.

Test case 2:
Initial = 2, Left = 2, Immigrated = 2 → Final = 2.




Program 2

Airlines

An airline operates X aircraft every day. Each aircraft can carry up to 100 passengers.
One day, N passengers would like to travel to the same destination.
What is the minimum number of new planes the airline must buy to carry all N passengers?

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
Each test case contains two space-separated integers:
X — the number of aircraft the airline currently owns
N — the number of passengers travelling

Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of planes the airline needs to purchase.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ X ≤ 10⁶
1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁶

Program
import math
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x,n=map(int,input().split())
    ans=0
    if n-(x*100)<=0:
        print(ans)
    else:
        ans=(n-(x*100))/100
        print(math.ceil(ans))

Input
3
4 600
3 523
8 245

Output
2
3
0

Explanation

Test case 1:
To carry 600 passengers, the airline needs 6 planes.
They have 4 → must buy 2 more.

Test case 2:
To carry 523 passengers, they need 6 planes.
They have 3 → must buy 3 more.

Test case 3:
To carry 245 passengers, they need 3 planes.
They have 8 → no need to buy any.
