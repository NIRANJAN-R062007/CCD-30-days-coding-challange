Program 1

Enormous Input Test

You are given N integers. Find the count of numbers divisible by K.

Input Format
The first line contains two positive integers N and K.
The next N lines each contain one positive integer, denoted by Ai.

Output Format
Output a single number — the count of integers divisible by K.

Constraints
1 ≤ N, K ≤ 10⁷
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10⁹

Program
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
ans = 0
for i in range(n):
	x = int(input())
	if x % k == 0:
		ans += 1
print(ans)

Input
7 3
1
51
966369
7
9
999996
11

Output
4

Explanation
The integers divisible by 3 are:
51
966369
9
999996
So, the total count is 4.






Program 2

Minimum number of Flips

Chef has an array A of length N consisting only of 1 and −1.
In one operation, Chef can choose any index i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) and multiply the element Ai by −1 (i.e., flip its sign).
Find the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the array equal to 0.
Output -1 if it is not possible to make the sum equal to 0.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
For each test case:
The first line contains an integer N — the length of the array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, …, AN.

Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of operations to make the sum equal to 0.
Output -1 if it is impossible.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
2 ≤ N ≤ 1000
Ai = 1 or Ai = −1

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n=int(input())
    A=list(map(int,input().split()))
    ans=sum(A)
    if ans%2!=0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(abs(ans)//2)

Input

2
1 -1

Output
2
-1
1
0

Explanation
Test case 1: Minimum operations = 2. Flip A3 and A4 : 1 + 1 − 1 − 1 = 0.
Test case 2: It is impossible to make the sum 0.
Test case 3: Flip A1 from 1 to -1 : −1 −1 −1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 0 → 1 operation.
Test case 4: Sum is already 0 → 0 operations needed.
