Program 1

Four Tickets

Four friends want to attend a concert. Each ticket costs X rupees.
They have decided to go to the concert if and only if the total cost of the tickets does not exceed 1000 rupees.

Determine whether they will be going to the concert or not.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single integer X, the cost of each ticket.

Output Format

For each test case, output YES if they will go to the concert, otherwise NO.

(Output is case-insensitive.)

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100

1 ≤ X ≤ 1000

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x=int(input())
    if x*4<=1000:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

Input
4
100
500
250
1000

Output
YES
NO
YES
NO

Explanation

Test case 1: Total cost = 100 × 4 = 400 ≤ 1000 → YES

Test case 2: Total cost = 500 × 4 = 2000 > 1000 → NO

Test case 3: Total cost = 250 × 4 = 1000 ≤ 1000 → YES

Test case 4: Total cost = 1000 × 4 = 4000 > 1000 → NO








Program 2

Water Mixing

Chef is setting up a perfect bath for himself. He has X litres of hot water and Y litres of cold water.
The initial temperature of water in his bathtub is A degrees.
On mixing water, the temperature of the bathtub changes as follows:

The temperature rises by 1 degree on mixing 1 litre of hot water.

The temperature drops by 1 degree on mixing 1 litre of cold water.

Determine whether he can set the temperature to B degrees for a perfect bath.

Input Format

The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of four space-separated integers A, B, X, Y —
the initial temperature of bathtub, the desired temperature, the litres of hot water, and the litres of cold water respectively.

Output Format

For each test case, output YES if Chef can get the desired temperature for his bath, and NO otherwise.

The output is case-insensitive.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 2000

20 ≤ A, B ≤ 40

0 ≤ X, Y ≤ 20

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    a,b,x,y= map(int, input().split())
    if b>a:
        print("YES" if b-a<=x else "NO")
    elif b<a:
        print("YES" if a-b<=y else "NO")
    else:
        print("YES")

Input
4
24 25 2 0
37 37 2 9
30 20 10 9
30 31 0 20

Output
YES
YES
NO
NO

Explanation

Test case 1:
Initial temp = 24, desired = 25 → need +1 degree → add 1 litre hot water → possible → YES.

Test case 2:
Already at desired temp → YES.

Test case 3:
Need −10 degrees but only 9 litres cold water available → NO.

Test case 4:
Need +1 degree but no hot water available → NO.
