Program 1

Bob at the Bank

Bob has an account in the Bobby Bank. His current account balance is W rupees.

Each month:

His office deposits X rupees.

The bank deducts Y rupees as charges.

You must find his final account balance after Z months.
Note: Bob's balance may become negative.

Input Format

First line: integer T, the number of test cases.

Each test case contains four integers:
W, X, Y, Z — initial amount, amount deposited per month, amount deducted per month, number of months.

Output Format

For each test case, print the final account balance after Z months.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000

1 ≤ W, X, Y, Z ≤ 10⁴

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    w,x,y,z=map(int,input().split())
    print(w+((x-y)*z))

Input
3
100 11 1 10
999 25 36 9
2500 100 125 101

Output
200
900
-25

Explanation

Test case 1:
Monthly change = +11 − 1 = +10
Final balance = 100 + (10 × 10) = 200

Test case 2:
Monthly change = +25 − 36 = −11
Final balance = 999 − (11 × 9) = 900

Test case 3:
Monthly change = +100 − 125 = −25
Final balance = 2500 − (25 × 101) = −25








Program 2

Recent contest problems

CodeChef recently revamped its practice page to make it easier for users to identify the next problems they should solve by introducing some new features:

Recent Contest Problems – Contains only problems from the last 2 contests

Separate Un-Attempted, Attempted, and All tabs

Problem Difficulty Rating – The Recommended dropdown menu has various difficulty ranges so that you can attempt the problems most suited to your experience

Popular Topics and Tags

Chef has been participating regularly in rated contests but missed the last two contests due to his college exams. He now wants to solve them and so he visits the practice page to view these problems.

Given a list of N contest codes, where each contest code is either START38 or LTIME108, help Chef count how many problems were featured in each of the contests.

Input Format

First line contains T, the number of test cases.

Each test case has two lines:

First line contains N, the total number of problems from the two recent contests.

Second line contains N contest codes, each either START38 or LTIME108.

Output Format

For each test case, output two integers in a single new line:

First integer = number of problems in START38

Second integer = number of problems in LTIME108

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10

1 ≤ N ≤ 1000

Each contest code is either START38 or LTIME108

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n=int(input())
    string=input().split()
    sc=0
    lc=0
    for j in string:
        if j=="START38":
            sc+=1
        elif j=="LTIME108":
            lc+=1
    print(sc,lc)

Input

2 4

Explanation

Test case 1: There are 2 START38 and 1 LTIME108.

Test case 2: There is 1 START38 and 3 LTIME108.

Test case 3: There are 0 START38 and 2 LTIME108.

Test case 4: There are 2 START38 and 4 LTIME108.
