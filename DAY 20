Program 1

Chef and Chapters

This semester, Chef took X courses.
Each course has Y units, and each unit has Z chapters in it.

Find the total number of chapters Chef has to study this semester.

Input Format
The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line with three space-separated integers X Y Z.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer — the total number of chapters Chef needs to study.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ X, Y, Z ≤ 1000

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x,y,z=map(int,input().split())
    print(x*y*z)

Input
3
1 1 1
2 1 2
1 2 3

Output
1
4
6

Explanation

Test case 1:
1 course × 1 unit × 1 chapter = 1 chapter.

Test case 2:
2 courses × 1 unit × 2 chapters = 4 chapters.

Test case 3:
1 course × 2 units × 3 chapters = 6 chapters.






Program 2

Jenga Night

Chef hosts a party for his birthday. There are N people at the party. All N people decide to play Jenga.

There are X Jenga tiles available.
In each round, every player picks 1 tile and places it in the tower.

The game is valid if:
All players get a tile in every round.
All tiles are used up by the end.
Given N and X, determine whether the game is valid.

Input Format
The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
Each test case contains a single line with two space-separated integers N X.

Output Format
For each test case, print YES if the game is valid, else print NO.
(Case-insensitive.)

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10⁴
1 ≤ N, X ≤ 1000

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n,x=map(int,input().split())
    if x%n==0:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

Input
3
3 3
4 2
2 4

Output
YES
NO
YES

Explanation

Test case 1:
3 tiles for 3 players → exactly 1 round → valid.

Test case 2:
2 tiles for 4 players → not enough tiles for even 1 round → invalid.

Test case 3:
4 tiles for 2 players → 2 rounds → all tiles used → valid.
