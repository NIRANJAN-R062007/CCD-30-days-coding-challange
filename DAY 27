Program 1

Passes for Fair

There is a fair going on in Chefland. Chef wants to visit the fair along with his N friends.
Chef manages to collect K passes for the fair.
Will Chef be able to enter the fair with all his N friends?

Each person needs one pass.

Each pass can be used by only one person.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two space-separated integers N K.

Output Format

For each test case, print YES if Chef can enter the fair with all his N friends, otherwise print NO.
(Output is case-insensitive.)

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100

1 ≤ N, K ≤ 100

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n,k=map(int,input().split())
    if n<k:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

Input
4
5 8
6 3
2 2
1 2

Output
YES
NO
NO
YES

Explanation

Test case 1:
Chef needs 5 passes for friends + 1 for himself = 6 passes. He collected 8 → YES

Test case 2:
Needs 7 passes total, has 3 → NO

Test case 3:
Needs 3 passes total, has 2 → NO

Test case 4:
Needs 2 passes total, has 2 → YES








Program 2

Mutated Minions

Gru has not been in the limelight for a long time and is planning something nefarious. Frustrated by his minions’ incompetence, he has built a transmogrifier — a machine that mutates minions.

Each minion has an intrinsic characteristic value (an integer). The transmogrifier adds an integer K to each of the minions’ characteristic values.

Gru knows that if the new characteristic value of a minion is divisible by 7, then it will have Wolverine-like mutations.

Given the initial characteristic integers of N minions, determine how many of them become Wolverine-like after transmogrification.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer T — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two lines:

First line: two integers N and K

Second line: N integers — the initial characteristic values of the minions

Output Format

For each test case, print a single integer — the number of Wolverine-like minions.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100

1 ≤ N ≤ 100

1 ≤ K ≤ 100

All characteristic values are between 1 and 10⁵ (inclusive)

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n,k=map(int,input().split())
    integers=input().split()
    ans=0
    for j in range(n):
        a=int(integers[j])
        if (a+k)%7==0:
            ans+=1
    print(ans)

Input
1
5 10
2 4 1 35 1

Output
1

Explanation

After transmogrification, the new values are:

{12, 14, 11, 45, 11}

Only 14 is divisible by 7, so 1 minion becomes Wolverine-like.
