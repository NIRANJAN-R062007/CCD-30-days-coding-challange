Program 1

Kitchen Timings:

The working hours of Chef’s kitchen are from X pm to Y pm
where
1≤X<Y≤12.
You need to find the number of hours Chef works.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers X and Y — the starting and ending time of working hours respectively.

Output Format:
For each test case, print on a new line the number of hours Chef works.

Constraints:
1≤T≤100
1≤X<Y≤12

Program:
x=int(input())
for i in range(x):
    y,z=map(int,input().split())
    print(z-y)

Sample Input:
4
1 2
3 7
9 11
2 10

Sample Output:
1
4
2
8

Explanation:
Test case 1: Chef starts at 1 pm and ends at 2 pm → works for 1 hour.
Test case 2: Chef starts at 3 pm and ends at 7 pm → works for 4 hours.
Test case 3: Chef starts at 9 pm and ends at 11 pm → works for 2 hours.
Test case 4: Chef starts at 2 pm and ends at 10 pm → works for 8 hours.



Program 2

Minimum Cars Required:

A single car can accommodate at most 4 people.
There are N friends who want to go to a restaurant for a party.
Find the minimum number of cars required to accommodate all the friends.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases.
Each of the next T lines contains a single integer N — denoting the number of friends.

Output Format:
For each test case, output the minimum number of cars required to accommodate all the friends.

Constraints:
1≤T≤1000
2≤N≤1000

Program:
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x=int(input())
    if x%4==0:
        print(int(x/4))
    else:
        print(int(x/4)+1)

Sample Input:
4
4
2
7
98

Sample Output:
1
1
2
25

Explanation:
Test case 1: There are 4 friends, and one car can accommodate 4 people → 1 car is required.
Test case 2: There are 2 friends → 1 car is enough.
Test case 3: There are 7 friends → 2 cars can accommodate up to 8 people → 2 cars are required.
Test case 4: There are 98 friends → 25 cars (each holding 4) are required to fit everyone.
