Program 1

Netflix

Alice, Bob, and Charlie are contributing to buy a Netflix subscription. However, Netflix allows only two users to share a subscription.
Given that Alice, Bob, and Charlie have A, B, and C rupees respectively, and a Netflix subscription costs X rupees, determine whether any two of them can contribute enough money to buy the subscription.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
Each test case contains four space-separated integers A B C X — the money that Alice, Bob, and Charlie have, and the cost of the subscription.

Output Format
For each test case, print YES if any two of Alice, Bob, and Charlie can together contribute ≥ X.
Otherwise, print NO.
(The output is case-insensitive.)

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ A, B, C, X ≤ 100

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    a,b,c,x=map(int,input().split())
    if a+b>=x or a+c>=x or b+c>=x:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

Input
4
1 1 1 3
2 3 1 5
4 2 3 4
2 1 4 7

Output
NO
YES
YES
NO

Explanation

Test case 1: No pair has enough money to reach 3 rupees.

Test case 2: Alice + Bob = 5 → enough to buy a subscription costing 5.

Test case 3: Bob + Charlie = 2 + 3 = 5 → enough for a 4-rupee subscription.

Test case 4: No two people can contribute enough to reach 7.








Program 2

Primality Test

Alice and Bob are meeting after a long time. As usual, they love to play math games.
This time Alice chooses the game: she says an integer, and Bob must say whether the number is prime or not.
Bob knows the logic, but Alice doesn’t give him much time, so he wants to write a program to determine if a number is prime.
Note: 1 is not a prime number.

Input
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
The next T lines each contain an integer N, which has to be tested for primality.

Output
For each test case, print "yes" if the number is prime, otherwise print "no", each on a new line.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 20
1 ≤ N ≤ 100000

Program
import math
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n <= 1:
        print("no")
        continue
    prime = True
    for j in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % j == 0:
            prime = False
            break
    print("yes" if prime else "no")

Input
5

Output

yes
no
no
