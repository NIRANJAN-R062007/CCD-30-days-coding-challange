Program 1

Spice Level

Each item in Chef’s menu is assigned a spice level from 1 to 10.
Based on the spice level, the item is categorized as:

MILD: if the spice level is less than 4

MEDIUM: if the spice level is greater than or equal to 4 but less than 7

HOT: if the spice level is greater than or equal to 7

Given the spice level X, determine the category of the item.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.

Each test case contains an integer X, the spice level.

Output Format

For each test case, output the category (MILD, MEDIUM, or HOT) on a new line.

(Output is case-insensitive.)

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ X ≤ 10

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x=int(input())
    if x<4:
        print("MILD")
    elif x>=4 and x<7:
        print("MEDIUM")
    elif x>=7:
        print("HOT")

Input
4
4
1
6
9

Output
MEDIUM
MILD
MEDIUM
HOT

Explanation

Spice level 4 → MEDIUM

Spice level 1 → MILD

Spice level 6 → MEDIUM

Spice level 9 → HOT






Program 2

Chef And Operators

Chef has just started Programming, he is in first year of Engineering. Chef is reading about Relational Operators.
Relational Operators are operators which check relationship between two values. Given two numerical values A and B you need to help chef in finding the relationship between them that is,

First one is greater than second or,

First one is less than second or,

First and second one are equal.

Input

First line contains an integer T, which denotes the number of testcases.
Each of the next T lines contain two integers A and B.

Output

For each line of input produce one line of output.
This line contains any one of the relational operators
< , > , =.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10000
1 ≤ A, B ≤ 1000000001

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    a,b=map(int,input().split())
    if a>b:
        print(">")
    elif a<b:
        print("<")
    else:
        print("=")

Input
3
10 20
20 10
10 10

Output
<
>
=

Explanation

In this example, 10 is lesser than 20.
