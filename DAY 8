Program 1

Mana Points
Chef is playing a mobile game. In the game, Chef's character Chefario can perform special attacks. However, one special attack costs X mana points to Chefario.
If Chefario currently has Y mana points, determine the maximum number of special attacks he can perform.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers X and Y — the cost of one special attack and the number of mana points Chefario has initially.

Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum number of special attacks Chefario can perform.

Constraints
1≤T≤100000
1≤X≤100
1≤Y≤1000

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x,y=map(int,input().split())
    print(y//x)

Input
3
10 30
6 41
50 2

Output
3
6
0

Explanation:
Test case 1: Chefario can perform a maximum of 3 special attacks which will cost him 30 mana points.
Test case 2: Chefario can perform a maximum of 6 special attacks which will cost him 36 mana points. 
            Note that Chefario can not perform 7 special attacks as these will cost him 42 mana points while he has only 41 mana points.
Test case 3: Chefario will not be able to perform any special attacks in this case.




Program 2

Cyclic Quadrilateral

You are given the sizes of angles of a simple quadrilateral (in degrees) A, B, C and D, in some order along its perimeter. Determine whether the quadrilateral is cyclic.
Note: A quadrilateral is cyclic if and only if the sum of opposite angles is 180∘

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers A, B, C and D.

Output
Print a single line containing the string "YES" if the given quadrilateral is cyclic or "NO" if it is not (without quotes).
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).

Constraints
1≤T≤10000
1≤A,B,C,D≤357
A+B+C+D=360

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    a,b,c,d=map(int,input().split())
    if a+c==180 and b+d==180:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

Input
3
10 20 30 300
10 20 170 160
179 1 179 1

Output
NO
YES
NO

Explanation:
Example case 1: The sum of two opposite angles A+C=10∘+30∘≠180∘.
Example case 2: The sum of two opposite angles A+C=10∘+170 ∘=180 ∘ and B+D=20∘+160∘=180∘.
Example case 3: The sum of two opposite angles B+D=1∘+1∘≠180∘.
