PROBLEM 1:

IPL Ticket Rush

Problem Statement:
A total of N students from DAIICT college want to attend an IPL match, but only M tickets are available for the match. We need to determine how many students will not be able to book tickets.

Input Format:
The input will consist of multiple test cases.

The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each subsequent test case consists of two space-separated integers N and M, representing the total number of students who want to go and the total number of tickets available, respectively.

Output Format:
For each test case, the output should be a single integer on a new line, indicating the number of students who will not be able to book tickets.

Constraints:
The following constraints apply to the input values:

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 105

Program:
def tick_check(num_students,num_tickets):
    chk=num_tickets-num_students
    if chk < 0:
        print(-1*chk)
    else:
        print(0)
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    a=input()
    array=a.split()
    num_students = int(array[0])
    num_tickets = int(array[1])
    tick_check(num_students, num_tickets)

Input
4
5 3
5 7
4 1
8 8

Output
2
0
3
0

Explanation:
Test case 1: There are 5 students who want to go, and only 3 tickets are available. Hence 2 students won't be able to get tickets.

Test case 2: There are 5 students who want to go, and 7 tickets are available. So, every one of them will get the tickets.

Test case 3: There are 4 students who want to go, and only ticket is available. Hence 3 students won't be able to get tickets.

Test case 4: There are students who want to go, and tickets are available. So, every one of them will get the tickets.








PROBLEM 2:

Weights

Problem Statement:
Chef is playing with weights. He has an object weighing W units. He also has three weights each of X, Y, and Z units respectively. Help him determine whether he can measure the exact weight of the object with one or more of these weights.
If it is possible to measure the weight of object with one or more of these weights, print YES, otherwise print NO.
You may print each character of the string in either uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings yes, YES, Yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).

Input Format:
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of single line containing four positive integers W, X, Y, and Z.

Output Format:
For each test case, output on a new line YES if it is possible to measure the weight of object with one or more of these weights, otherwise print NO.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10⁴
1 ≤ W, X, Y, Z ≤ 10⁵

Program:
def can_measure(W, X, Y, Z):
    # Check all possible combinations of weights
    if (W == X or W == Y or W == Z or
        W == X + Y or W == X + Z or W == Y + Z or
        W == X + Y + Z):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    a=input()
    lst=a.split()
    W=int(lst[0])
    X=int(lst[1])
    Y=int(lst[2])
    Z=int(lst[3])
    print(can_measure(W, X, Y, Z))

Input
4
5 2 1 6
7 9 7 2
20 8 10 12
20 10 11 12

Output
NO
YES
YES
NO

Explanation:
Test Case 1:
 It is not possible to measure 5 units using any combination of given weights.
Test Case 2:
 Chef can use the second weight of 7 units to measure the object exactly.
Test Case 3:
 Chef can use the combination of first and third weights to measure 8 + 12 = 20 units.
Test Case 4:
 Chef cannot measure 20 units of weight using any combination of given weights.
