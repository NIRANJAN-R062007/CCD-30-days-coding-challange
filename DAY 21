Masterchef Finals

Chef has been working hard to compete in MasterChef.
He is ranked X out of all contestants. However, only 10 contestants are selected for the finals.

Check whether Chef made it to the top 10 or not.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
Each test case contains one integer X — Chef’s current rank.

Output Format
For each test case, print YES if Chef made it to the top 10, otherwise print NO.
(You may print the output in any letter case.)

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ X ≤ 100

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x=int(input())
    if x<=10:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

Input
4
15
10
1
50

Output
NO
YES
YES
NO

Explanation

Test case 1: Rank = 15 → not in top 10 → NO

Test case 2: Rank = 10 → in top 10 → YES

Test case 3: Rank = 1 → in top 10 → YES

Test case 4: Rank = 50 → not in top 10 → NO





Program 2

Bath in Winters

A geyser has a capacity of X litres of water and a bucket has a capacity of Y litres of water.

One person requires exactly 2 buckets of water to take a bath.
Find the maximum number of people that can take bath using water from one completely filled geyser.

Input Format
The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
Each test case contains two integers X Y.

Output Format
For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of people who can take a bath.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 100

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x,y=map(int,input().split())
    print(x//(y*2))

Input
4
10 6
25 1
100 10
30 40

Output
0
12
5
0

Explanation

Test case 1:
Bucket = 6L → water per person = 12L.
Geyser has only 10L → 0 people.

Test case 2:
Bucket = 1L → water per person = 2L.
Geyser = 25L → 25/2 = 12 people.

Test case 3:
Bucket = 10L → water per person = 20L.
Geyser = 100L → 5 people.

Test case 4:
Bucket = 40L → water per person = 80L.
Geyser = 30L → 0 people.
