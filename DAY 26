Program 1

CodeChef Airlines

Chef has opened a new airline. He has 10 airplanes, and each airplane has a capacity of X passengers.
On the first day, Y people want to book a seat in any one of Chef’s airplanes.

Given that Chef charges Z rupees for each ticket, find the maximum amount of money Chef can earn on the first day.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.

Each test case contains three space-separated integers X, Y, Z:

X — capacity of each airplane

Y — number of people wanting to book

Z — cost of each ticket

Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the maximum amount Chef can earn.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ X, Y, Z ≤ 100

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x,y,z=map(int,input().split())
    if x*10>=y:
        print(y*z)
    else:
        print(10*x*z)

Input
4
2 15 10
1 10 1
5 60 100
1 11 7

Output
150
10
5000
70

Explanation

Test case 1:
Total seats = 10 × 2 = 20
People = 15 → all 15 can book
Money = 15 × 10 = 150

Test case 2:
Total seats = 10 × 1 = 10
People = 10 → all 10 can book
Money = 10 × 1 = 10

Test case 3:
Total seats = 10 × 5 = 50
People = 60 → only 50 can book
Money = 50 × 100 = 5000

Test case 4:
Total seats = 10 × 1 = 10
People = 11 → only 10 can book
Money = 10 × 7 = 70








Program 2

Get Lowest Free

Chef goes to the supermarket to buy some items. There is a sale:

👉 If Chef buys 3 items, he gets the item with the lowest price among the 3 for FREE.

Example:
If the 3 item prices are 6, 2, 4, Chef gets the 2-priced item free and pays 6 + 4 = 10.

Chef buys 3 items priced A, B, C.
Find the amount Chef needs to pay.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer T — number of test cases.

Each test case contains three integers A, B, C — the prices of the items.

Output Format

For each test case, output the price Chef pays.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 10

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
    print(a+b+c-min(a,b,c))

Input
3
6 2 4
3 3 3
8 4 4

Output
10
6
12

Explanation

Test case 1: Free item = 2 → pay 6 + 4 = 10

Test case 2: All items are 3 → free one 3 → pay 3 + 3 = 6

Test case 3: Free item = 4 → pay 8 + 4 = 12
