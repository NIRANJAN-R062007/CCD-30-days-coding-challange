Puzzle Hunt

Chef and some of his friends are planning to participate in a puzzle hunt event.

The rules of the puzzle hunt state:
"This hunt is intended for teams of 6 to 8 people."

Chef's team has N people in total. Are they eligible to participate?

Input Format

The first and only line of input contains a single integer N — the number of people in Chef’s team.

Output Format

Print Yes if Chef’s team is eligible to participate, and No otherwise.

Each letter may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase (e.g., YES, yes, yEs are all valid).

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10

Program
n=int(input())
if n in [6,7,8]:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")

Sample 1
Input
4

Output
No

Explanation

The puzzle hunt requires between 6 and 8 people.
4 is not in that range, so Chef’s team cannot participate.

Sample 2
Input
7

Output
Yes

Explanation

7 lies between 6 and 8.
So, Chef’s team can participate.

Sample 3
Input
8

Output
Yes

Explanation

8 is within the required range.
So, Chef’s team can participate.








Program 2

Nearest Exit

There are two exits in a bus with 100 seats:

First exit is located beside seat number 1.

Second exit is located beside seat number 100.

Seats are arranged in a straight line from 1 to 100 with equal spacing between any 2 adjacent seats.

A passenger prefers to choose the nearest exit while leaving the bus.

Determine the exit taken by the passenger sitting on seat X.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single integer X, the seat number.

Output Format

For each test case, output LEFT if the passenger chooses the exit beside seat 1, and RIGHT otherwise.

(Output is case-insensitive.)

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100

1 ≤ X ≤ 100

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x=int(input())
    if x<=50:
        print("LEFT")
    else:
        print("RIGHT")

Input
6
1
50
100
30
51
73

Output
LEFT
LEFT
RIGHT
LEFT
RIGHT
RIGHT

Explanation

Seat 1 → exit at seat 1 is immediate → LEFT

Seat 50 → distance to seat 1 is 49, to seat 100 is 50 → LEFT

Seat 100 → nearest exit is at seat 100 → RIGHT

Seat 30 → distance to seat 1 is 29, to seat 100 is 70 → LEFT

Seat 51 → distance to seat 1 is 50, to seat 100 is 49 → RIGHT

Seat 73 → distance to seat 1 is 72, to seat 100 is 27 → RIGHT
