Program 1

Audible Range

Chef's dog Binary can hear frequencies from 67 Hertz to 45000 Hertz (both inclusive).

Given Chef's command frequency X (in Hertz), determine whether Binary can hear it.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
Each test case contains a single integer X — the frequency of Chef's command.

Output Format
For each test case, print YES if Binary can hear the command, otherwise print NO.
(Output is case-insensitive.)

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10⁴
1 ≤ X ≤ 10⁶

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x=int(input())
    if x>=67 and x<=45000:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

Input
5
42
67
402
45000
45005

Output
NO
YES
YES
YES
NO

Explanation

42 is less than 67 → NOT audible

67 is within [67, 45000] → audible

402 is within range → audible

45000 is within range → audible

45005 is greater than 45000 → NOT audible








Program 2

Complementary Strand in a DNA

You are given the sequence of nucleotides of one strand of DNA through a string S of length N.
The string S contains only the characters A, T, C, G.

Chef knows that:

A is complementary to T

T is complementary to A

C is complementary to G

G is complementary to C

Using the string S, determine the sequence of the complementary DNA strand.

Input Format
The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
Each test case has two lines:
First line: integer N, the length of string S
Second line: string S

Output Format
For each test case, output a string of length N representing the complementary DNA strand.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
S contains only A, T, C, G

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n=int(input())
    s=input()
    ans=""
    for j in s:
        if j=='A':
            ans+='T'
        elif j=='T':
            ans+='A'
        elif j=='C':
            ans+='G'
        else:
            ans+='C'
    print(ans)
