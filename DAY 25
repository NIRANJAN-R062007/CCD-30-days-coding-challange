Program 1

Just One More Episode

Chef has to attend an exam that starts in X minutes, but of course, watching shows takes priority.

Every episode of the show that Chef is watching is 24 minutes long.
If he starts watching a new episode now, will he finish watching it strictly before the exam starts?

Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing a single integer X — the amount of time from now at which Chef's exam starts.

Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line:

YES if Chef will finish the episode before the exam starts

NO otherwise

(You may print the answer in any mix of uppercase/lowercase.)

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100

1 ≤ X ≤ 100

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x=int(input())
    if x>24:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

Input
4
30
23
60
24

Output
Yes
No
Yes
No

Explanation

Test case 1: 30 minutes available → enough for a 24-minute episode → Yes

Test case 2: 23 minutes available → not enough → No

Test case 3: 60 minutes available → enough → Yes

Test case 4: 24 minutes → finishes exactly when exam starts, not strictly before → No






Program 2

Exams

In Chefland, there are X schools, and each school has Y students.
The year-end results are in and a total of Z students passed the exams.

Assuming that all students appeared for the exams, find whether the number of students who passed in Chefland was strictly greater than 50%.

Input Format

The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of three space-separated integers X, Y, Z, as mentioned in the statement.

Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line:

YES, if the total number of students who passed was strictly greater than 50%

NO, otherwise

(Output is case-insensitive.)

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10⁴

1 ≤ X ≤ 5

1 ≤ Y ≤ 50

0 ≤ Z ≤ X⋅Y

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x,y,z=map(int,input().split())
    if (z/(x*y))*100>50:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

Input
4
2 10 12
2 10 3
1 5 3
3 6 9

Output
YES
NO
YES
NO

Explanation

Test case 1: Total students = 2⋅10 = 20, passed = 12 → 60% > 50% → YES

Test case 2: Total students = 20, passed = 3 → 15% < 50% → NO

Test case 3: Total students = 5, passed = 3 → 60% > 50% → YES

Test case 4: Total students = 18, passed = 9 → 50% = 50% → NOT strictly greater → NO
