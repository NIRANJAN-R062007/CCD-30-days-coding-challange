Program 1

The Gift
Om has X rupees. He wants to gift a laptop worth N rupees to his girlfriend.
We know that Om is the technical secretary of IIIT-A and has access to the Gymkhana funds of IIIT-A. Currently there are M rupees in the fund and Om can use the fund as much as he wants.
Find whether Om can gift his girlfriend a new laptop.

Input Format
The first and only line of input contains three space-separated integers X, N, and M — the amount Om has, the price of the laptop, and the amount present in the Gymkhana fund respectively.

Output Format
For each input, output YES if Om can buy the laptop and NO otherwise.
You may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example YES, Yes, yes, and yES are all considered the same.

Constraints
1≤X,N,M≤1000
 
Program
x,n,m=map(int,input().split())
if n<=x+m:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")

Sample 1:
Input
5 10 15

Output
YES

Explanation:
Om uses 5 rupees from Gymkhana fund. So, the amount he has is 
5+5=10 rupees. He can buy the laptop with cost 10 rupees.

Sample 2:
Input
4 50 7

Output
NO

Explanation:
Even if Om uses the whole Gymkhana fund, he won't be able to buy the laptop.

Program 2

Greater Average
You are given 3 numbers A,B, and C.
Determine whether the average of 
A and B is strictly greater than C or not?
NOTE: Average of A and B is defined as (A+B)/2. For example, average of 5 and 9 is 7, average of 5 and 8 is 6.5.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.Each test case consists of 3 integers A,B, and C.

Output Format
For each test case, output YES if average of A and B is strictly greater than C, NO otherwise.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YeS, yEs, yes and YES will all be treated as identical).

Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤A,B,C≤10

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    a,b,c=map(int,input().split())
    if (a+b)/2 > c:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

Input
5
5 9 6
5 8 6
5 7 6
4 9 8
3 7 2

Output
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES

Explanation:
Test case 1: The average value of 5 and 9 is 7 which is strictly greater than 6.
Test case 2: The average value of 5 and 8 is 6.5 which is strictly greater than 6.
Test case 3: The average value of 5 and 7 is 6 which is not strictly greater than 6.
Test case 4: The average value of 4 and 9 is 6.5 which is not strictly greater than 8.
Test case 5: The average value of 3 and 7 is 5 which is strictly greater than 2.
