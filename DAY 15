Program 1

Chairs Requirement

Chef's coding class is very famous in Chefland.
This year X students joined his class and each student requires one chair to sit on. Chef already has Y chairs in his class.
Determine the minimum number of new chairs Chef must buy so that every student gets a chair.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases.
Each test case contains two integers X and Y — the number of students and the number of chairs Chef already has.

Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of extra chairs Chef must buy.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
0 ≤ X, Y ≤ 100

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x,y=map(int,input().split())
    if y>x:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(abs(y-x))

Input
4
20 14
41 41
35 0
50 100


Output
6
0
35
0


Explanation
Test case 1: 20 students, 14 chairs → need 6 more chairs.
Test case 2: 41 students, 41 chairs → need 0 chairs.
Test case 3: 35 students, 0 chairs → need 35 chairs.
Test case 4: 50 students, 100 chairs → already enough chairs.





Program 2

Chef Eren

Chef is a very big fan of Eren Yeager.
In the last season of Attack on Titan, there were N episodes numbered from 1 to N.
Each even-indexed episode was A minutes long and each odd-indexed episode was B minutes long.
Calculate the total duration (in minutes) of the last season.

Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains three integers N, A, B, the number of episodes and the durations of each even-indexed and odd-indexed episode respectively in minutes.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single integer on a new line — the total duration of the last season in minutes.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 60
1 ≤ A, B ≤ 60

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n,a,b=map(int,input().split())
    d=0
    for j in range(1,n+1):
        if j%2==0:
            d+=a
        else:
            d+=b
    print(d)

Input
3
1 2 2
2 3 4
4 20 30

Output
2
7
100

Explanation

Test case 1:
There is only 1 episode → 1 odd-indexed episode, 0 even-indexed episodes.
Total duration = 0·A + 1·B = 0·2 + 1·2 = 2.

Test case 2:
Episodes: {1, 2} → 1 odd, 1 even.
Total duration = 1·A + 1·B = 1·3 + 1·4 = 7.

Test case 3:
Episodes: {1, 2, 3, 4} → 2 odd, 2 even.
Total duration = 2·A + 2·B = 2·20 + 2·30 = 100.
