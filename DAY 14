Program 1

Bull or Bear

Chef is on his way to becoming the new big bull of the stock market but is a bit weak at calculating whether he made a profit or a loss on his deal.
Given that Chef bought the stock at value X and sold it at value Y, help him determine whether he made a PROFIT, LOSS, or the deal was NEUTRAL.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
Each test case contains two space-separated integers X and Y, the buying price and the selling price.

Output Format
For each test case, output:
PROFIT if Y > X
LOSS if Y < X
NEUTRAL if Y = X
The checker is case-insensitive.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 500
1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 100

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x,y=map(int,input().split())
    if y-x>0:
        print("PROFIT")
    elif y-x==0:
        print("NEUTRAL")
    else:
        print("LOSS")

Input
4
4 2
8 8
3 4
2 1

Output
LOSS
NEUTRAL
PROFIT
LOSS

Explanation:
Test case 1: X > Y → LOSS
Test case 2: X = Y → NEUTRAL
Test case 3: X < Y → PROFIT
Test case 4: X > Y → LOSS




Program 2

Reach fast

Chef is standing at coordinate A while Chefina is standing at coordinate B.
In one step, Chef can increase or decrease his coordinate by at most K.
Determine the minimum number of steps required by Chef to reach Chefina.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of three integers A, B, K — the initial coordinate of Chef, the coordinate of Chefina, and the maximum distance Chef can move in one step.

Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of steps required by Chef to reach Chefina.

Constraint
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ A, B ≤ 100
1 ≤ K ≤ 100

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    a,b,k=map(int,input().split())
    d=abs(a-b)
    print((d+k-1)//k)

Input
4
10 20 3
36 36 5
50 4 100
30 4 2


Output
4
0
1
13


Explanation
Test case 1: Chef needs 4 steps — three steps of +3 (total +9) and one step of +1 (≤ K) to reach from 10 to 20.
Test case 2: Chef is already at Chefina's coordinate, so 0 steps are needed.
Test case 3: Chef can decrease by 46 in one step (≤ K = 100), so 1 step.
Test case 4: Chef decreases by 2 each step; 13 steps of −2 move from 30 to 4.
