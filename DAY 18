Program 1

Candy Division

There are three friends and a total of N candies.
There will be a fight if all of them do not get the same number of candies.
Chef wants to divide all the candies such that there is no fight.
Find whether such a distribution is possible.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
Each test case contains a single integer N — the total number of candies.

Output Format
For each test case, output YES if all candies can be divided equally among the three friends.
Otherwise, output NO.
(Answer is case-insensitive.)

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 100

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n=int(input())
    if n%3==0:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

Input
4
3
4
2
6

Output
YES
NO
NO
YES

Explanation

Test case 1:
3 candies → each friend gets 1 → possible.

Test case 2:
4 candies → cannot divide equally among 3 friends → not possible.

Test case 3:
2 candies → not divisible by 3.

Test case 4:
6 candies → each gets 2 → possible.




Program 2

Mario and Bullet

Mario's bullet moves at X pixels per frame. He wishes to shoot a goomba standing Y pixels away from him. The goomba does not move.
Find the minimum time (in seconds) after which Mario should shoot the bullet, such that it hits the goomba after at least Z seconds from now.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line with three space-separated integers X Y Z.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum time (in seconds) after which Mario should shoot the bullet so that it hits the goomba at or after Z seconds from now.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ X, Y, Z ≤ 100
X divides Y (i.e., Y is a multiple of X)

Notes
Time for the bullet to travel from Mario to the goomba = Y / X seconds (an integer because X divides Y).
If travel time ≥ Z, Mario can shoot immediately → answer 0.
Otherwise, Mario must wait Z − (Y / X) seconds before shooting.

Program
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x,y,z=map(int,input().split())
    ans=y//x
    print(max(0,z-ans))

Input
3
3 3 5
2 4 1
3 12 8

Output
4
0
4

Explanation

Test case 1: travel time = 3/3 = 1s, Z = 5 → wait 5 − 1 = 4s.

Test case 2: travel time = 4/2 = 2s, Z = 1 → travel time already ≥ Z → wait 0s.

Test case 3: travel time = 12/3 = 4s, Z = 8 → wait 8 − 4 = 4s.
