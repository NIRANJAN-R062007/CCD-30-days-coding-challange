Program 1

Determine the Score

Chef appeared for a placement test.

There is a problem worth X points. Chef finds out that the problem has exactly 10 test cases.
Each test case is worth the same number of points.

Chef passes N test cases.
Determine the score Chef will get.

Input Format
The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
Each test case contains two integers X N, the total points of the problem and the number of test cases Chef passes.

Output Format
For each test case, output the score Chef gets.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
10 ≤ X ≤ 200
0 ≤ N ≤ 10
X is a multiple of 10

Program 
t=int(input())
for i in range(t):
    x,n=map(int,input().split())
    print(int((x/10)*n))
    
Input
4
10 3
100 10
130 4
70 0

Output
3
100
52
0

Explanation

Test case 1:
Total points = 10 → each test case = 1 point.
Chef passes 3 → score = 3.

Test case 2:
Total points = 100 → each test case = 10 points.
Chef passes 10 → score = 100.

Test case 3:
Total points = 130 → each test case = 13 points.
Chef passes 4 → score = 52.

Test case 4:
Total points = 70 → each test case = 7 points.
Chef passes 0 → score = 0.



Program 2

Chef and NextGen

Chef works for a secret research group called NEXTGEN. They have achieved two major breakthroughs:
1.Building a nuclear reactor that can use Helium-3 as fuel
2.Extracting all Helium-3 from the moon

To receive government funding, the project must prove its worth by generating at least A units of power per year for B years.

You are given:
X grams of Helium-3 available on the moon
1 gram of Helium-3 provides Y units of power

Determine whether the project can generate enough total power to meet the government's requirement.

Input Format
First line: integer T, number of test cases
Each test case: four integers A B X Y

Output Format
For each test case, output Yes if NEXTGEN meets the power requirement, otherwise output No.
(Output is case-insensitive.)

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ A, B, X, Y ≤ 1000

Program
T=int(input())
for i in range(T):
    A,B,X,Y=map(int,input().split())
    if A*B<=X*Y:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

Input
4
1 2 3 4
4 3 2 1
2 18 9 4
1 100 2 49

Output
Yes
No
Yes
No

Explanation

Test case 1:
Required power = A × B = 1 × 2 = 2
Available power = X × Y = 3 × 4 = 12 → enough → Yes

Test case 2:
Required = 4 × 3 = 12
Available = 2 × 1 = 2 → not enough → No

Test case 3:
Required = 2 × 18 = 36
Available = 9 × 4 = 36 → enough → Yes

Test case 4:
Required = 1 × 100 = 100
Available = 2 × 49 = 98 → not enough → No
